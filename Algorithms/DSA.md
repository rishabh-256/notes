Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

Data structures are of two types:
- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure

Big O Notation -  is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your programs grows as input size grows
### Time Complexity

#### Linear 

we start from taking the slope intercept-linear function > y = mx +b

time = a\*n + b

1.Keep the fastest growing term ? because as the programs and input grows, rest values becomes irrelevant  > time = a\*n

2.Drop all constants

- time = O(n) =  order of n

when the time of programs grows linearly depending on the input, its time complexity is order O(n)

#### Constant 

time = a

1.Keep the fastest growing term & 2.Drop all constants
- time = O(1)

#### Quadratic
time = a\*nÂ², + b\*n + c
1.Keep the fastest growing term
2.Drop all constants
time = O(n^2)
